* The New Territories refers to any non-human or human with significant cyborg implants as The Altered. 
* The Altered are not outlawed and there are no legal sanctions against them. However, they are generally looked down upon and feared by society. 
* As a result, many of them choose to spend much of their time in places like [The Void](The_Void), though places like it are getting rarer and rarer. These places are being settled over time.
