# Overview

* Hivemind who are the shopkeepers at [[Verslun]].
* There to provide some comic relief in an otherwise dark atmosphere.
* Naming convention is 
  1. Some fancy title, 
  2. "Reginald"
  3. Letter and number designation
    * Letter is prime (numeric cyphyer for the alphabet) followed by a prime number.
    * Prime letters are B, C, E, G, K, M, Q, S, W
  * Exception here could be someone with no title that goes by Reggie.

## Captain Reginald B3
* Shopkeeper at [Verslun B3](Verslun#verslun-b3).
* Very excitable and complimentary towards his customers.
* Think a really happy, outgoing, eccentric Mr. Burns (from the Simpsons).
* This may be a good time to hint at the [legend of the four](Legend_of_the_four). This should be subtle. Maybe he just says something like "Four of you ... and you just came here? Four ... Hmm. How very curious indeed."
