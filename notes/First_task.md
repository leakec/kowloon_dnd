* The first task involves bringing a known mob boss, [[Shun]] back to the Ringleader.
	* The award is higher if she is brought alive, but the Ringleader is okay with her being dead as well. Reward starts at 400 GP alive and 250 GP dead. However, players may negotiate this, and bring up the total to 500 GP alive and 300 GP dead.
* If players are good, then harp on the fact that [[Shun]] is evil. She is brutal and those who live in the buildings she controls must pay money for her "protection."
* If players are less interested in this, then harp on the reward. 
* [[Shun]] will be located in the tall building northwest of the purple light.

## Puzzle
* The puzzle is the players must act out a play. The play is spread out on 4 sheets, one that each of the characters find by using one of their skills.
* The play itself should relate to the [legend of the five](Legend_of_the_five.md).
* I think it makes sense as a way either to get to [[Shun]] or a place [[Shun]] somehow sends them mid-battle (the latter option is pretty unique and interesting). 
* Use this to force some RP and give some lore at the same time.
* Some of the sheets should be hidden behind at least one puzzle. Maybe do the coin puzzle? 9 coins and you need to find the fake one.

The Legend of the Four: Act 3/3
Yet, in the relentless pursuit of their noble mission, these five unknowingly unleash a cataclysmic tide upon the city, a maelstrom of discord and despair. Each attempt to rectify their inadvertent transgressions only deepens the chasm of chaos, plunging the once-vibrant city into the abyss of destruction.

As the city teeters on the precipice of annihilation, an unexpected twist of destiny unfolds. A formidable gang of organized criminals seizes control, casting the city into the relentless grip of malevolence. The citizens, once hopeful, now find themselves ensnared in the ruthless web spun by these nefarious overlords.

The five, who had once aspired to be the city's salvation, have become unwitting catalysts for its undoing. Mystery shrouds the future, as the once-unlikely saviors must confront the dire consequences of their actions. The city's fate hangs in the balance, as it languishes in the iron grip of organized crime, its citizens suffering in silence.
## Battle
* The players will need to battle [[Shun]] and her minions. 
* Based on [this](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/194-a-new-dms-guide-for-building-combat-encounters) I'm thinking [[Shun]] should be 3/4 the characters challenge rating and she should have two minions that are 1/2 the characters challenge rating. The players are level 5 so I'm thinking Shun as level 4 and two minions at level 2 would be good.
* It is okay to go a little hard during battle and bring [[Brick]] or [Galan Ianfiel](Galan_Ianfiel) in as needed.
* The two minions should be [shadow drakes](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=640).

## Mystery
* Tied to the [legend of the five](Legend_of_the_five.md).
* The puzzle should give some hint that the five have arrived.
* Somehow [[Shun]] should get wind of this, either as a final question before death or in travel back to the [[Ringleader]]. Something like how did you get in here and what did the puzzle say on the way in? She should be shocked by this, then laughing that [The Void](The_Void) is fucked.
