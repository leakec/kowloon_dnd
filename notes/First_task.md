* The first task involves bringing a known mob boss, [[Shun]] back to the Ringleader.
	* The award is higher if she is brought alive, but the Ringleader is okay with her being dead as well. Reward starts at 400 GP alive and 250 GP dead. However, players may negotiate this, and bring up the total to 500 GP alive and 300 GP dead.
* If players are good, then harp on the fact that [[Shun]] is evil. She is brutal and those who live in the buildings she controls must pay money for her "protection."
* If players are less interested in this, then harp on the reward. 
* [[Shun]] will be located in the tall building northwest of the purple light.

## Puzzle
* The puzzle is the players must act out a play. The play is spread out on 4 sheets, one that each of the characters find by using one of their skills.
* The play itself should relate to the [legend of the four](Legend_of_the_four).
* I think it makes sense as a way either to get to [[Shun]] or a place [[Shun]] somehow sends them mid-battle (the latter option is pretty unique and interesting). 
* Use this to force some RP and give some lore at the same time.

## Battle
* The players will need to battle [[Shun]] and her minions. 
* Based on [this](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/194-a-new-dms-guide-for-building-combat-encounters) I'm thinking [[Shun]] should be 3/4 the characters challenge rating and she should have two minions that are 1/2 the characters challenge rating. The players are level 5 so I'm thinking Shun as level 4 and two minions at level 2 would be good.
* It is okay to go a little hard during battle and bring [[Brick]] or [Galan Ianfiel](Galan_Ianfiel) in as needed.
* The two minions should be [shadow drakes](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=640).

## Mystery
* Tied to the [legend of the four](Legend_of_the_four).
* The puzzle should give some hint that the four have arrived.
* Somehow [[Shun]] should get wind of this, either as a final question before death or in travel back to the [[Ringleader]]. Something like how did you get in here and what did the puzzle say on the way in? She should be shocked by this, then laughing that [The Void](The_Void) is fucked.

## To do

* Map for the play
* Handouts for the play
