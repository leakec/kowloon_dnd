* Quiet 
* He is the iron worker that takes time to speak to the PCs if they notice him.
    * Perception check and if they roll high enough they notice him looking out of place and staring at them.
* Level 4 or 5 barbarian
* Seems hesitant to join them but then does?
  * Depending on the interaction, this could be at first, or maybe he just shows up later if they are in need of help.
