* Pronounced "varslune"
* First shop the players will encounter.
* [[Reginald]] is the shopkeeper here.
* There to provide some comic relief in an otherwise dark atmosphere.
* Shop has a well lit interior. Inisde stands in constrast to other buildings. Think LED bulbs set to white. Not super bring, but certainly brighter than other areas.
* Also has a few beds upstairs the players can rent.

# TODO
* Add items to the shop
