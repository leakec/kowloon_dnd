* This is the name of the city.

# TODO
* Review the introduction about the city.

# Introduction
The Void got its name as the people and objects that go in rarely leave. It's like a gyre that pulls in anything that gets too near. Even information rarely escapes its spiraling maw. It's not like nothing is known about it, but more like the little that is known about it is riddled with uncertainty and mystery. The merchants of the New Territories that regularly trade with The Void know little more than the straightforward routes they take to the edge of the city, the names of those they trade with&ndash;if those even are their real names&ndash;and prices the buyers are willing to trade for their goods. They, the merchants, rarely, if ever, wander into the city's depths, and if they do, its always during the day before most of The Void's citizens are up.

The rumors in the New Territories vary. What is known for sure is that The Void governs itself and that said governance is distributed. In other words, there is no centralized authority; no law or enforcers as the New Territories&ndash;and the rest of the world for that matter&ndash;are used to. Rather, The Void keeps itself from descending into anarchy via emergent properties of its residents' personalities: the altruism of the kind individuals that look out for one another, the necessary hierarchies that form as a part of the cities organized crime, etc. As you might imagine, this attracts certain types of people. I like to separate them into four categories:

* **Innocents** - Those who want some cheap, tax-free housing, a quiet life.
* **Explorers** - These people are drawn in by the mystery and legends of The Void. Some seek the legendary, expensive objects that have disapeared into The Void. Others are more interested in the mysteries surrounding the city. I put bounty hunters in this category as well: seeking people, or there remains, who are wanted in the New Territories and have escaped into the void. 
* **Entrepreneurs** - The Void's lack of taxes and total relaxation of laws attracts many different kinds unique business opportunities. From producing extremely cheap goods to new medications to technology advances, business ventures in The Void form an ever growing list. Of course, the lack of laws attracts other, more sinister business as well, which leads to our last category.
* **Criminals** - The lack of laws, relative mystery, and dense urban layout of the city make it the perfect place for criminals and fugitives. 

As you might imagine, The Void is criticized by most of the citizens of the New Territories more than it is praised. Most consider it a hideous, terrible place. A place where magic and scientific endeavors can be performed without repercussion. Yet, none of them deny the city's beauty: the multicolored lights that dance with the mist and fog that roll down from the mountains every evening; the intricate labyrinth of streets, alleys, secret passageways, and make-shift, high-rise pathways that dissect what would otherwise be one, giant, monolithic building; the way the city pulses and churns with light and energy against the darkness as its citizens, in an analogous fashion, provide a pressure to stave off the ever-looming threat of societal collapse and descent into total chaos. It's beautiful and awe-inspiring in the same way as a terrific thunderstorm or the raging ocean is. 

I've always been warned against heading into The Void. But ... it's so tempting ...

## Extras 
The sky is a blaze of golden orange as the sun sets behind the mountains that separate The Void and the New Territories; the natural, blooming light of the sun dances and mingles with various neon purples and cyans coming from The Void's city lights. The alleys and small spaces between skyscrapers are eerily quiet today as the majority of The Void's residents begin to emerge from their homes.
