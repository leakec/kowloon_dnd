# Introduction
Journal entry 11:

The Void got its name as the people and objects that enter rarely leave. It's like a gyre that pulls in anything that gets too near. Even information rarely escapes its spiraling maw. It's not like nothing is known about it, more like the little that is known about it is riddled with uncertainty and mystery. The merchants of the New Territories that regularly trade with The Void know little more than the straightforward routes they take to the edge of the city, the names of those they trade with&ndash;if those even are their real names&ndash;and prices the buyers are willing to trade for their goods. They, the merchants, rarely, if ever, wander into the city's depths, and if they do, it's always during the day, while most of The Void's citizens are sleeping.

The rumors in the New Territories vary. What is known for sure is that The Void governs itself and that said governance is distributed. In other words, there is no centralized authority; no law or enforcers as the New Territories&ndash;and the rest of the world for that matter&ndash;are used to. Rather, The Void keeps itself from descending into anarchy via emergent properties of its residents' personalities: the altruism of the kind individuals that look out for one another, the necessary hierarchies that form as a part of the city's organized crime, etc. As you might imagine, this attracts certain types of people. I like to separate them into four categories:

* **Innocents** - Those who want to live a quiet, happy life. Many that fall into this category are too poor to live in the New Terroitories. They move to The Void for the cheap, tax-free housing. 
* **Outcasts** - Those who don't feel welcome in society tend to find more acceptance, or at least not outright hatred, in The Void. For example, many scientists and inventors with outrageous ideas far ahead of their time or those endowed with supernatural abilities feared or frowned upon find it easier to hone their craft in The Void.
* **Explorers** - These people are drawn in by the mystery and legends of The Void. Some seek the rare, expensive objects that have disapeared behind The Void's borders. Others are more interested in the mysteries surrounding the city. I'd put bounty hunters in this category as well: seeking people, or their remains, who are wanted in the New Territories and have escaped into The Void. 
* **Entrepreneurs** - The Void's lack of taxes and laws attracts many different kinds of unique business opportunities. From producing extremely cheap goods to new medications and technological advances, business ventures in The Void form an ever growing list. Of course, the lack of laws attracts other, more sinister business as well, which leads to the last category.
* **Criminals** - The lawlessness, relative mystery, and dense urban layout of the city make it the perfect place for criminals and fugitives. 

As you might imagine, The Void is criticized more often than praised by the citizens of the New Territories. Most consider it an impious, terrible place. A place where magic and scientific endeavors can be pursued without repercussion. Yet, none of them deny the city's beauty: the multicolored lights that dance with the mist and fog that roll down from the mountains every evening; the intricate labyrinth of streets, alleys, secret passageways, and make-shift, high-rise pathways that dissect what would otherwise be one, giant, monolithic building; the way the city pulses and churns with light and energy against the darkness as its citizens, in an analogous fashion, provide a pressure that staves off the ever-looming threat of societal collapse and descent into total chaos. It's beautiful and awe-inspiring in the same way as a terrific thunderstorm or the raging ocean.

I've always been warned against heading into The Void. But ... it's so tempting ...

## Extras 
The sky is a blaze of golden orange as the sun sets behind the mountains that separate The Void and the New Territories; the natural, blooming light of the sun dances and mingles with various neon purples and cyans coming from The Void's city lights. The alleys and small spaces between skyscrapers are eerily quiet today as the majority of The Void's residents begin to emerge from their homes.
