* Meet Galan at the club or just outside.
	* Has a flirty encounter with one of the players. 
	* Doesn't have to be super interested in them but enough that they notice.
	* Once [[Ringleader]] realizes there are 4 people, need to have Galan converse with the Ringleader. This is important for the first task later.
* Easy encounter in the club? Could be related to the above. Maybe use 2 [fletchlings](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=669)?


* Meet the [[Ringleader]] back at [[Luciferin]]. Negotiate a price.
* Have them have a small encounter first in the alleyway. Fight 3 [imps](https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=109).
* Shop at [[Verslun]].
* Do the first task 
	* Galan should show up at one point. Fires an arrow. Use this to balance encounter. Need to make it ambiguous who it should hit. Players should not know whose side he is on.
